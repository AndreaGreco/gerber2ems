# OpenEMS simulation with KiCAD
## Setup
Needed tools are:
* `KiCAD` - editing the PCB
* `Octave` - interfacing with openEMS, setting up simulation, postprocessing and ploting some results
* `OpenEMS` - simulation
* `Paraview` - viewing simulation results (creating images etc.)
* `pcbmodelgen` - importing PCB's from kicad to openems

To install, first install `KiCad` and `Octave`. Then download, compile and install `OpenEMS`: https://docs.openems.de/install.html#linux. After that install `Paraview`. Finally download, compile and install `pcbmodelgen`: https://github.com/jcyrax/pcbmodelgen
